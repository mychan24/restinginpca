# Abstract for OHBM 2020

### Abstract
- Intro: 
	- motivation from the limitation of aging study (could be applied to lesion, developmental study)
	- standard way of doing these
	- some data has individualized parcellation
	- DiSTATIS cannot be done on it without coercing it into a group-atlas parcellatoin
	- Here is away to look at difference between subjects or session given the constrain of unequal network size
	- A paper showing brain connectivity of participants that only have one brain hemisphere !! (https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(19)31381-6)
- Method: 
	- how we generate networks
	- set-up of techniques
	- #18 HMFA (subject, [between vs. within])
	- DiSTATIS	
- Restults:
	- We could coerce data into a group-atlas and do DISTATIS
	- Compare to DiSTATIS using Gordon333 & mean-connectivity matrix using individual parcellation
	- Simulated results (session differences)
- Discussion: 
	- the pre-processing steps should be optional based on the research question
	- different preprocessing step
	- if you have strong reason to retain individualized parcels, our method is an option to show multivarate results
