> To compare the regular rs*f*MRI analysis to our new method.

1. Perform DiSTATIS on mean connectivity of network edges derived from individual parcellation (MeanIndivParc).

2. Perform DiSTATIS on the connectivity derived from Gordon's parcellation (GordonParc).

3. Perform DiSTATIS on the mean connectivity of network edges derived from Gordon's parcellation (MeanGordonParc).
