# How is our method better?

---

## Step one --

Compared to DiSTATIS:

- (1) DiSTATIS with Gorden's parcellation

- (2) DiSTATIS with mean connectivity based on Gordon's parcellation

- (3) DiSTATIS with mean connectivity based on individual parcellation

- *Our method: HMFA with subject first and edgetype (between vs. within) then*

- *Expectation*:

	+ Compared to (1), (2) will miss some effect because the pattern within each edge is smoothed and the some effect will be missed.

	+ Compared to (3), (2) will be less likely to detect effects in small networks 
	> need another simulation in small network

	+ Compare to our SVD, (3) will miss the effect of patterns
