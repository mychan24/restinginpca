## Plot the rectangular matrix into a symmetrical square matrix
## Note: Map factor scores to a square matrix that has the same rows and columns as the correlation matrix that is analyzed

## Function name: vec2sqmat
## Input:
##      (1) data2map: n x 1 vector; 
##                a vector with matching lengths of n, and n is the number of intersections in the upper triangle of the 
##                square matrix (diagonal included)
## Output:
##      An m x m square matrix with the matching length of dimensions
## Note:
##      m is found by solving the quadratic equation: m^2 - m - 2*n = 0, because m = sqrt(2*n - m)
##      a = 1, b = -1, c = -2*n, m = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a, only the positive solution is considered
